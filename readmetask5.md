### Traffic Accident Data Analysis
## Overview
This task focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. It includes various visualizations to help understand accident hotspots and contributing factors.

### Files
traffic_accident_analysis.pdf: A PDF file containing the code and analysis.
visualizations.png: A PNG file with the visualizations created from the analysis.
accident_hotspots.html: An interactive heat map of accident hotspots.
accident_marker_cluster.html: An interactive marker cluster map with detailed popups for each accident.
### Analysis and Visualizations
Scatter Plot of Accident Locations
Visualizes the geographic distribution of accidents using latitude and longitude to identify patterns in accident locations.

Pie Charts for Severity and Weather Conditions
Displays the distribution of accidents by severity and the top 10 weather conditions, providing insights into how different weather conditions affect accident severity.

Count Plot for Top Cities with Highest Number of Accidents
Highlights the cities with the highest number of accidents, helping to pinpoint high-risk areas.

## Monthly Accident Analysis for 2020 with Annotations
Analyzes the number of accidents by month in 2020, with annotations for significant seasonal disasters, showing trends and anomalies.

## Heat Map of Accident Hotspots
Creates a heat map to identify areas with a high concentration of accidents, visualizing accident density.

## Marker Cluster Map
Develops a marker cluster map to show the distribution and density of accidents, with detailed information for each accident location.

Steps to View and Run the Analysis
## Ensure you have a PDF viewer:

Open traffic_accident_analysis.pdf to review the code and analysis.
## View the visualizations:

Open visualizations.png to see the generated visualizations.
## Interactive Maps:

Open accident_hotspots.html in your web browser to view the interactive heat map.
Open accident_marker_cluster.html in your web browser to view the interactive marker cluster map.
If running the Python script (not included due to file size limitations):

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, folium).
Unzip the folder and navigate to the directory containing the script.
Execute the script using Python.
### Notes
The PDF and PNG files are provided due to platform limitations that prevent uploading large Python files.
Adjustments to the analysis can be made by referencing the code in the PDF.
