## Task 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Wine Quality Dataset
## Overview
This project involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Wine Quality dataset to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in wine quality.

## Dataset Information
The Wine Quality dataset consists of various chemical properties of red wine and their quality ratings on a scale from 3 to 8. The goal is to analyze these features to understand their impact on wine quality.

## Patterns and Trends

### Quality Distribution: The majority of wines have quality ratings of 5, 6, or 7. Few wines have extremely low (3) or high (8) quality ratings.

### Correlation Analysis:

### Alcohol: Positive correlation with wine quality.
### Sulphates: Moderate positive correlation with wine quality.
### Density: Negative correlation with wine quality.
### Volatile Acidity: Negative correlation with wine quality.
### Feature vs. Quality Analysis:

##### Fixed Acidity: No clear pattern with wine quality.
##### Citric Acid: Slight positive correlation with wine quality.
##### Residual Sugar: No clear pattern with wine quality.
##### Chlorides: Wines with lower chloride levels tend to have better quality.
##### Free Sulfur Dioxide: No clear pattern with wine quality.
##### Total Sulfur Dioxide: Wines with lower total sulfur dioxide levels tend to have slightly better quality.
##### pH: No clear pattern with wine quality.

### Visualizations
Bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps used for analysis.
